## About the Project

The goal of this project is to build an API capable of supporting the functionalities of Galho Seco, a D&D character sheet manager app for mobile devices.

Galho Seco will allow users to create, edit and rolls tests on their D&D character sheet wherever and whenever they want.

One of the main goals of this project is to integrate the app with [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) to allow players to roll tests for their characters without the need of being connected to Foundry VTT.
